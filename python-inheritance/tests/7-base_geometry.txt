# 7-base_geometry Test File
# This file describes the expected behavior of BaseGeometry class.

- BaseGeometry.area() should raise an Exception with message: "area() is not implemented"
- BaseGeometry.integer_validator(name, value) should:
    * raise TypeError if value is not an integer with message: "<name> must be an integer"
    * raise ValueError if value <= 0 with message: "<name> must be greater than 0"
